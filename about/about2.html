    <h3>Cobbers Bicycle Chop</h3>
    <p>Cobbers Bicycle Chop was established in 2000 the heart of Tennessee with a strong focus on adventure, customer loyalty, and to be your trusted source for the best outdoor gear. Fast forward to 2022, we recognized the demand of a growing local bike market, and Cobbers Bicycle Chop opened a mobile service to provide adventurers the same personal experience, top quality bikes and gear, and passion for the outdoors that inspires us to get out and cobber life!</p>
    <h3>Why we love being Cobbers</h3>
    <img class="bikewreck" src="/imgs/about-cobbers-pic2.webp" alt="cyclist having a wreck">
    <p><strong>We know accidents happen when you least expect it</strong>, thats we have developed a mobile team that can be there when you need them the most. Our Cobbers repair van has helped the USA Olympic bike team win 98 straight gold medals. Our Cobbers are also the reason Tony Hawke switched over to riding bicycles and left his skate board behind. We want everyone to be as passionate about riding bicycles as we are.</p>
